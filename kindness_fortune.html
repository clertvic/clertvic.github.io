                        <p>Kindness Fortune is a conceptual Ubiquitous Computing system designed to encourage people to perform daily acts of kindness. Kindness Fortune takes a person’s lifestyle and overall schedule into account and suggests appropriate actions of kindness for that person at the optimal time. Inspired by <a href="http://www.corning.com/ADayMadeofGlass/" target="_blank">Corning’s Vision for the Future</a>, the system makes suggestions by displaying prompts of kindness on surfaces that make sense for the user. For example, a student’s prompt might appear on their notebook or binder, whereas a working adult’s prompt might appear on their desk at work or newspaper in the morning.</p>

                    <h4>Field Research</h4>
                    <p>The initial goal of this project was to envision future systems that can enhance tranquility, togetherness, and a sense of divine in a place of religious or spiritual practice such as church, synagogue, mosque, etc. We spent the first few weeks investigating different religions through interviews and attending religious services. This included Unitarian Universalism, Christianity at a Baptist Megachurch, Buddhism at a Thai Temple, Mormonism, Hinduism, and Wicca.</p>

                    <h4>Design Process</h4>
                    <div class="col_66 left">
                        <p>Based on the research findings, we generated 50+ design concepts. We consolidated them and developed 10 storyboards for our top ideas. Using the Speed Dating technique, we quickly showed our 10 storyboards to potential users of different faiths and beliefs to get feedback and suggestions on our ideas.</p>
                        <p>Although we could have focused only on a particular religion, we thought it would be interesting to focus on something in common as well. For example, love and kindness, whether to others, to oneself, to those unlike me, or to nature, were the common topics we found in our research across all religions and sets of beliefs. One of the storyboards we developed for this idea was the Kindness Keychain. Most people gave positive feedback on the Kindness Keychain during the speed dating sessions. They liked to be reminded of things that they value but don’t always remember to do. However, many of them noticed that the keychain might not be the best form factor because some people saw it as a to-do item rather than a suggestion and some people don’t use one.</p>

                    <h4>Final Deliverable</h4>
                    <p>Our final design was inspired by <a href="http://youtu.be/6Cf7IL_eZ38/" target="_blank">“A Day Made of Glass” vision by Corning</a>. Rather than having to carry a device and seeing it as a to-do item, the prompt would appear in convenient places and at the right moment to optimize chances for acts of kindness.</p>
                    <p>In the final presentation, we pitched the design concept including a summary of the design process, details of the design, and a video sketch communicating the experience of use.</p>
