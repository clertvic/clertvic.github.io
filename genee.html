Clinical Specialists educate prescribers about the potential benefits and treatment strategies of Genentech medicines.</p>
                        <p>Our solution, Genee, is a set of software and hardware tools designed and developed to support the informational needs of Clinical Specialists, allowing them to make informed decisions on planning their sales calls.</p>

                    <div class="col_66 left">
                        <p>Prior to meeting with Clinical Specialists, we educated ourselves about pharmaceutical sales domain by looking at industry publications, company whitepapers, online articles, and job postings. We also delved into various Customer Relationship Management systems developed specifically for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in our competitive analysis.</p>

                    <h4>Field Research</h4>
                    <p>We applied a number of human-centered research techniques to understand Clinical Specialists’ ecosystem and challenges they face during their work process. We spent about 5 hours with each of them observing how they work in the real context and interviewing them. We conducted Contextual Inquiry and Shadowing to understand their decision-making process and interactions with Health Care Providers. Immediately after shadowing the Clinical Specialists’ sales calls, we performed Retrospective Interviews to deconstruct their perception of how they felt the meeting went. We used a participatory activity called People Mapping in which we asked Clinical Specialists to visually describe where they fit into the organization. This method allowed us to see their relationships with internal and external key stakeholders as well as the types of information they exchange. We also conducted in-person interviews with home office people such as IT Architect, UX Lead, Business Analysts, and Marketers to understand how they gather requirements, prioritize features, and develop applications for Clinical Specialists.</p>

                    <h4>Data Analysis and Synthesis</h4>
                    <p>We used a structured interpretation process to build a shared understanding, organize our research data, and systematically identify underlying issues. We transcribed interviews and constructed flow and cultural models for each research participant. Flow models showed responsibilities and communications between different roles whereas cultural models revealed the influences of other parties on a research participant that eventually impacted his/her work. To gain the big picture of the ecosystem, we merged all flow models into a single consolidated flow model. This consolidation helped us focus more on the roles each research participant actually plays, rather than just what their job titles say. We also created affinity diagrams by grouping interpretation notes in a hierarchical structure. Affinity diagrams helped us identify common themes and issues mentioned by Clinical Specialists and home office stakeholders.</p>

                    <h4>Visioning and Concept Validation</h4>                        
                    <p>Based on the insights derived from the previous processes, we brainstormed and came up with visions that would address the identified issues. Each vision was a storyboard illustrating how a user would operate a hypothetical tool to solve their problem. We conducted concept validation sessions using the Speed Dating technique where we quickly showed several concepts through storyboards. The feedback and suggestions from our users and fellow students helped us narrow down the focus of our visions to two most promising concepts.</p>

                    <h4>Iterative Design Process</h4>
                    <div class="col_66 left">
                        <p>With the two most promising concepts in mind, we produced prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively tested them with Clinical Specialists to improve the design. To quickly give form to our ideas, we created a series of hand-drawn paper screens for our low-fidelity prototypes. We then made a transition of our concepts into the digital realm by implementing interactive wireframes in Axure for our mid-fidelity prototype. To allow greater flexibility and richness of interaction, we developed our final working prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>After each round of prototyping, we conducted user-testing sessions with Clinical Specialists. Our user tests were focused on information needs, functionality, and usability. We analyzed the results from each user test and refined our prototypes to meet Clinical Specialists’ needs. Due to the confidential nature of this project, I cannot disclose further details here.</p>
